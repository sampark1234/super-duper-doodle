<h2><strong>Chord Modulation</strong></h2>

<p>In music, modulation is most commonly the act or process of changing from one key (tonic, or tonal center) to another.<br> This may or may not be accompanied by a change in key signature. Modulations articulate or create the structure or form of many pieces, as well as add interest.<br> Treatment of a chord as the tonic for less than a phrase is considered tonicization.</p>
